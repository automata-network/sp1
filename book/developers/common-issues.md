# Common Issues

## Alloy Errors

If you are using a library that depends on `alloy_sol_types`, and encounter an error like this:

```txt
perhaps two different versions of crate `alloy_sol_types` are being used?
```

This is likely due to two different versions of `alloy_sol_types` being used. To fix this, you can set `default-features` to `false` for the `sp1-sdk` dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
sp1-sdk = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false }
```

This will configure out the `network` feature which will remove the dependency on `alloy_sol_types`
and configure out the `NetworkProver`.

## Rust Version Errors

If you are using `alloy` or another library that has an MSRV (minimum support rust version) of 1.76.0
or higher, you may encounter an error like this when building your program.

```txt
package `alloy v0.1.1 cannot be built because it requires rustc 1.76 or newer, while the currently active rustc version is 1.75.0-nightly`
```

This is due to the fact that the Succinct Rust toolchain is built with version 1.75, which is older
than the MSRV of the `alloy` crate. Note: Once the Succinct Rust toolchain is updated, this error will
go away.

To fix this, you can:

- If using `cargo prove build` directly, pass the `--ignore-rust-version` flag:

  ```bash
  cargo prove build --ignore-rust-version
  ```

- If using `build_program`, set `ignore_rust_version` to true inside the `BuildArgs` struct and use
  `build_program_with_args`:

  ```rust
  let args = BuildArgs {
      ignore_rust_version: true,
      ..Default::default()
  };
  build_program_with_args("path/to/program", args);
  ```

## Stack Overflow Errors

If you encounter the following in a script using `sp1-sdk`:

```txt
thread 'main' has overflowed its stack
fatal runtime error: stack overflow
```

```txt
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Re-run your script with `--release`.

## C Binding Errors

If you are building a program that uses C bindings or has dependencies that use C bindings, you may encounter the following errors:

```txt
cc did not execute successfully
```

```txt
Failed to find tool. Is `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` installed?
```

To resolve this, re-install sp1 with the `--c-toolchain` flag:

```bash
sp1up --c-toolchain
```

This will install the C++ toolchain for RISC-V and set the `CC_riscv32im_succinct_zkvm_elf` environment
variable to the path of the installed `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` binary. You can also use your own
C++ toolchain be setting this variable manually:

```bash
export CC_riscv32im_succinct_zkvm_elf=/path/to/toolchain
```
